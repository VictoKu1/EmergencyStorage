# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Private reports:** Email the maintainers at `security@emergencystorage.dev` with a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact. We prefer coordinated disclosure and will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- **GitHub Security Advisories:** If preferred, open a private security advisory via GitHub so we can coordinate a fix and release.
- **Do not open public issues** for vulnerabilities until we have confirmed and patched the problem.

## Supported Versions

- The `main` branch and the latest released tag receive security fixes.
- Older tags may receive fixes on a best-effort basis.

## Expectations

- We will investigate, prioritize, and patch confirmed issues as quickly as possible.
- We will credit reporters in release notes if they wish.
- Please avoid tests that could disrupt shared infrastructure when reproducing issues.
