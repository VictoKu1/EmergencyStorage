# Dynamic Mirror Update System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the dynamic mirror update system for EmergencyStorage, specifically for Kiwix mirrors.

## Problem Statement
The original system had hardcoded mirror URLs in the bash script, which could become outdated. The goal was to:
1. Automatically update mirror lists from official sources
2. Store mirrors in a structured JSON format
3. Run updates every 24 hours via automation
4. Make the system extensible for other data sources

## Solution Implemented

### Components Created

#### 1. Python Scraper (`scripts/update_mirrors.py`)
- Scrapes https://mirror.download.kiwix.org/mirrors.html
- Parses HTML to extract mirror URLs
- Categorizes mirrors by protocol (rsync, ftp, https)
- Uses both HTML parsing and regex for robust extraction
- Saves results to JSON file

#### 2. Mirror Storage (`data/mirrors/kiwix.json`)
```json
{
  "source": "kiwix",
  "last_updated": "ISO timestamp",
  "mirrors": {
    "rsync": [...],
    "ftp": [...],
    "https": [...]
  }
}
```

#### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/update-mirrors.yml`)
- Runs daily at 00:00 UTC via cron schedule
- Can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch
- Executes Python scraper
- Commits and pushes changes if mirrors updated
- Uses github-actions bot for commits

#### 4. Modified Kiwix Script (`scripts/kiwix.sh`)
- Added `load_mirrors_from_json()` function
- Uses Python to parse JSON and extract mirrors by protocol
- Falls back to hardcoded mirrors if:
  - JSON file doesn't exist
  - Python is not available
  - JSON parsing fails
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### 5. Documentation
- `data/mirrors/README.md` - Mirror system documentation
- Updated main README.md with feature information
- Added to project structure documentation

#### 6. Testing (`test_mirrors.sh`)
- Validates JSON file exists and structure is correct
- Tests mirror loading functionality
- Checks Python script syntax
- Verifies GitHub Actions workflow exists
- Validates bash script syntax

## Key Features

### ✅ Automation
- Fully automated daily updates
- No manual intervention required
- Self-maintaining mirror lists

### ✅ Reliability
- Graceful fallback to hardcoded mirrors
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Works even if JSON or Python unavailable

### ✅ Extensibility
- Designed to support multiple data sources
- JSON structure allows easy addition of new sources
- Scraper can be extended for other mirror pages

### ✅ Transparency
- JSON format is human-readable
- Easy to inspect current mirrors
- Can be manually edited if needed

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
```
✓ JSON file exists
✓ JSON structure valid (14 rsync, 7 ftp, 16 https mirrors)
✓ Mirror loading function works
✓ Python script syntax valid
✓ GitHub Actions workflow present
✓ Bash script syntax valid
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Python for scraping**: More robust HTML parsing than pure bash
2. **JSON for storage**: Standard format, easy to parse and maintain
3. **Fallback mechanism**: Ensures reliability even if automation fails
4. **GitHub Actions**: Built-in, no external services needed
5. **Daily schedule**: Balances freshness with resource usage

## Benefits

1. **Always up-to-date mirrors**: Automatic updates ensure current mirror lists
2. **Improved reliability**: More mirrors available, better download success rates
3. **Reduced maintenance**: No manual mirror list updates needed
4. **Future-ready**: System designed for easy extension to other sources
5. **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality fully preserved

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to easily support:
- Additional data sources (OpenZIM, OpenStreetMap, etc.)
- Mirror health checking and prioritization
- Geographic-based mirror selection
- Mirror response time tracking
- Multi-source JSON file with shared structure

## Files Changed

New files:
- `.github/workflows/update-mirrors.yml`
- `data/mirrors/kiwix.json`
- `data/mirrors/README.md`
- `scripts/update_mirrors.py`
- `test_mirrors.sh`

Modified files:
- `scripts/kiwix.sh` (added JSON loading, maintained fallback)
- `.gitignore` (excluded Python cache)
- `README.md` (added feature documentation)

## Verification

To verify the implementation:
```bash
# Run tests
./test_mirrors.sh

# Manually update mirrors
python3 scripts/update_mirrors.py

# Test script with dry-run
scripts/kiwix.sh /tmp/test_dir false
```

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements:
- ✅ Dynamic mirror updates (not hardcoded)
- ✅ Automated scraping from official source
- ✅ 24-hour update schedule via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Extensible design for future sources
- ✅ Currently working for Kiwix
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
